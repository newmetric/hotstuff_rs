//! HotStuff-rs works to safely replicate a state machine in multiple processes. In our terminology, these processes are
//! called 'replicas', and therefore the set of all replicas is the 'replica set'. Each replica is uniquely identified
//! by an Ed25519 public key.
//! 
//! Not every replica has to vote in consensus. Some operators may want to run replicas that merely keep up to consensus
//! decisions, without having weight in them. We call these replicas 'listeners', and call the replicas that vote in
//! consensus 'validators'. HotStuff-rs needs to know the full 'validator set' at all times to collect votes, but does not
//! need to know replicas.
