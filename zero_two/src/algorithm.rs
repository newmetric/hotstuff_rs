//! This module defines the algorithm thread and the procedures used in it. The algorithm thread is the driving
//! force of a HotStuff-rs replica, it receives and sends [crate::messages::ProgressMessage](progress messages) using 
//! the network to cause the [crate::state](Block Tree) to grow in all replicas in a safe and live manner.
//! 
//! The algorithm thread is a forever loop of increasing view numbers. On initially entering this loop, the replica
//! compares the view of the [highest qc it knows](crate::state::BlockTree::highest_qc) with the 
//! [highest view it has previously entered](crate::state::BlockTree::highest_view_entered), selecting the higher
//! of the two, plus 1, as the view to execute.
//! 
//! A view proceeds in one of two modes, depending on whether the depending on whether the local replica is a
//! [crate::replica](validator or a listener). Replicas automatically change between the two modes as the validator
//! set evolves.
//! 
//! The execution of a view in validator mode [execute_view](proceeds) as follows. The execution in listener view is
//! exactly the validator mode flow minus all of the proposing and voting:
//! 1. If I am the current leader (repeat this every proposal re-broadcast duration):
//!     * If the highest qc is a generic or commit qc, call the app to produce a new block, broadcast it in a proposal,
//!       and send a vote to the next leader.
//!     * Otherwise, broadcast a nudge and send a vote to the next leader.
//!     * Then, if I *am not* the next leader, move to the next view.
//! 2. Then, poll the network for progress messages until the view timeout:
//!     * [on_receive_proposal](On receiving a proposal):
//!         - Call on the block tree to [crate::state::BlockTree::validate](validate) the proposed block.
//!         - Call on the app to validate it.
//!         - If it passes both checks, insert the block into the block tree and send a vote for it to the next leader.
//!         - Then, if I *am not* the next leader, move to the next view.
//!     * [on_receive_nudge](On receiving a nudge):
//!         - Check if its quorum certificate is higher that the block tree's highest qc.
//!         - If yes, then store it as the highest qc and send a vote for it to the next leader.
//!         - Then, if I *am not* the next leader, move to the next view.
//!     * [on_receive_vote](On receiving a vote):
//!         - Collect the vote.
//!         - If enough matching votes have been collected to form a quorum certificate, store it as the highest qc.
//!         - Then, if I *am* the next leader, move to the next view.
//!     * [on_receive_new_view](On receving a new view):
//!         - Check if its quorum certificate is higher than the block tree's highest qc.
//!         - If yes, then store it as the highest qc.
//! 
//! A view eventually times out and transitions if a transition is not triggered 'manually' by one of the steps. If a
//! view timed out without making progress (proposing a block, sending out a vote, or collecting or receving a new 
//! highest qc), then the algorithm thread tries to [sync](sync) with other replicas before moving on to the next view.
