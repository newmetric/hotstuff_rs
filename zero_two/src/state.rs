//! This module defines types and methods used to access and mutate the persistent state that a HotStuff-rs
//! validator keeps track for the operation of the protocol, and for its application.
//! 
//! This state may be stored in a key-value store of the library user's own choosing, as long as that KV store
//! can provide a type that implements [KVWrite], [KVGet], and [KVCamera]. This state can be mutated through
//! an instance of [BlockTree], and read through an instance of [BlockTreeSnapshot].
//! 
//! HotStuff-rs structures its state into separate conceptual 'variables' which are stored in tuples that sit
//! at a particular key path or prefix in the library user's chosen KV store. These variables are:
//! - **Blocks** ([CryptoHash] -> [Block]).
//! - **Block Number to Block** ([BlockNumber] -> [CryptoHash]): a mapping between a block's number and a block's hash. This mapping only contains blocks that are committed, because if a block hasn't been committed, there may be multiple blocks at the same height.
//! - **Block Hash to Children** ([CryptoHash] -> [ChildrenList]): a mapping between a block's hash and the children it has in the block tree. A block may have multiple chilren if they have not been committed.
//! - **Committed App State** ([Key] -> [Value]).
//! - **Committed Validator Set** ([ValidatorSet]).
//! - **Pending App State Updates** (`CryptoHash -> AppStateUpdates`).
//! - **Pending Validator Set Updates** (`CryptoHash -> ValidatorSetUpdates`).
//! - **Locked View** (`ViewNumber`): the highest view number of a quorum certificate contained in a block that has a child.
//! - **Highest View Entered** (`ViewNumber`): the highest view that this validator has entered.
//! - **Highest Quorum Certificate** (`QuorumCertificate`): among the quorum certificates this validator has seen and verified the signatures of, the one with the highest view number.
//! 
//! The location of each of these variables in a KV store is defined in [kv_paths]. Note that the fields of a
//! block are itself stored in different tuples. This is so that user code can get a subset of a block's data
//! without loading the entire block from storage, which may be expensive. The key suffixes on which each of
//! block's fields are stored are also defined in [kv_paths].
