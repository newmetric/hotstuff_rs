//! Definitions for structured messages that are sent between replicas as part of the
//! [`HotStuff`][crate::hotstuff::protocol::HotStuff] protocol.
//! 
//! ## Messages
//! 
//! HotStuff-rs' modified HotStuff protocol involves four types of messages:
//! 1. [`Proposal`]: broadcasted by the leader of a given view, who proposes to extend the blockchain by 
//!    inserting a block contained in the proposal.
//! 2. [`Nudge`]: broadcasted by the leader of a given view, who nudges other validators to participate in
//!    a next voting phase for a block with a given quorum certificate.
//! 3. [`Vote`]: sent by a validator to the leader of a next view to vote for a given proposal or nudge,
//!    contains a cryptographic signature over the information passed through a vote.
//! 4. [`NewView`]: sent by a replica to the next leader on view timeout, serves to update the next leader
//!    on the highestQC that replicas know of.
//! 
//! ## `NewView` and view synchronization
//! 
//! In the original HotStuff protocol, the leader of the next view keeps track of the number of
//! `NewView` messages collected in the current view with the aim of advancing to the next view once a
//! quorum of `NewView` messages are seen. This behavior can be thought of as implementing a rudimentary
//! view synchronization mechanism, which is helpful in the original HotStuff protocol because it did
//! not come with a "fully-featured" BFT view synchronization mechanism.
//! 
//! HotStuff-rs, on the other hand, *does* include a separate BFT view synchronization mechanism (in the
//! form of the [Pacemaker](crate::pacemaker) module). Therefore, we deem replicating this behavior
//! unnecessary.
