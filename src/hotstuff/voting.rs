//! Functions that define which replicas are allowed to propose and vote at any given point in the
//! execution of the HotStuff subprotocol.
//!
//! ## Validator Set Update protocol
//!
//! HotStuff-rs' modified HotStuff SMR adds an extra "decide" phase to the phased HotStuff protocol.
//! This phase serves as the transition phase for the validator set update, and is associated with
//! the following invariant which implies the liveness as well as immediacy of a validator set update:
//!
//! > "If there exists a valid decideQC for a validator-set-updating block, then a quorum from the new
//! > validator set has committed the block together with the validator-set-update, and hence is ready
//! > to act as the newly committed validator set"
//!
//! Concretely, suppose B is a block that updates the validator set from vs to vs'. Once a commitQC
//! for B is seen, vs' becomes the committed validator set, and vs is stored as the previous validator
//! set, with the update being marked as incomplete. While the update is incomplete, vs may still be
//! active: it is allowed to re-broadcast the proposal for B or nudges for B. This is to account for the
//! possibility that due to asynchrony or byzantine behaviour not enough replicas may have received the
//! commitQC, and hence progressing to a succesful "decide" phase is not possible without such
//! re-broadcast. Once a valid decideQC signed by a quorum of validators from vs' is seen, the update is
//! marked as complete and vs becomes inactive.

/// ## Preconditions
///
/// `justify` satisfies [`safe_qc`](crate::state::safety::safe_qc) and

/// associated with this `justify` have already been applied.
