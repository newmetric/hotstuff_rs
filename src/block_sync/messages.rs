//! Definitions for structured messages that are sent between replicas as part of the Block Sync
//! protocol.
//!
//! ## Messages
//!
//! The Block Sync protocol defines two categories of messages:
//!
//! 1. Block Sync Protocol messages ([`BlockSyncMessage`]): exchanged between a sync client and sync
//!    server when the client is trying to sync with the server.
//! 2. Block Sync Server Advertisements ([`BlockSyncAdvertiseMessage`]): periodically broadcasted by
//!    sync servers to update the sync clients on:
//!     1. Their availability and commitment to providing blocks at least up to a given height
//!        ([`AdvertiseBlock`]).
//!     2. Whether the quorum is making progress in a future view, as evidenced by the server's local
//!        Highest QC ([`AdvertiseQC`]).
