//! Implements the [BlockSyncServer] for the block sync protocol, which helps the replicas lagging 
//! behind catch up with the head of the blockchain in a safe and live manner. A replica might be
//! lagging behind for various reasons, such as network outage, downtime, or deliberate action
//! by Byzantine leaders.
//! 
//! The server's responsibility as part of the protocol is to:
//! 1. Respond to block sync requests ("block sync process" part of the protocol),
//! 2. Periodically broadcast advertisements which serve to notify other replicas about the server's
//!    availability and view of the blockchain ("block sync trigger" and "block sync server selection").
//! 
//! ## Block sync process
//! 
//! As part of the sync process, the server responds to any received sync requests with blocks starting
//! from a given start height. The number of blocks sent back in a response is limited by a configurable
//! limit.
//! 
//! The client side of this protocol is explained [here](crate::block_sync::client).
//! 
//! ## Block sync trigger and block sync server selection
//! 
//! Maintaining a sync server that periodically notifies other replicas about its state of the block
//! tree and its availability plays an important role in ensuring that lagging replicas try to sync 
//! when there is evidence that they are lagging behind, and that they sync with a peer who is ahead 
//! of them.
//! 
//! A block sync server notifies others about its availability and state of the block tree in two ways:
//! 1. AdvertiseQC: to let others know about the server's highestQC known, which may trigger sync if they are behind,
//! 2. AdvertiseBlock: to let others know about the server's highest committed block height, so that they can decide 
//!    if the server is a suitable sync peer.
