//! Functions that [initialize](Replica::initialize) and [start](Replica::start) a replica, as well as [the type](Replica) which
//! keeps the replica alive.
//!
//! HotStuff-rs works to safely replicate a state machine in multiple processes. In our terminology, these processes are
//! called 'replicas', and therefore the set of all replicas is called the 'replica set'. Each replica is uniquely identified
//! by an Ed25519 public key (ed25519-dalek::VerifyingKey).
//!
//! ## Validators and Listeners
//!
//! Not every replica has to vote in consensus. Some operators may want to run replicas that merely keep up with consensus
//! decisions, without having weight in them. We call these replicas 'listeners', and call the replicas that vote in
//! consensus 'validators'.
//!
//! HotStuff-rs needs to know the full 'validator set' at all times to collect votes, but does not need to know the identity
//! of listeners. But for listeners to keep up with consensus decisions, they also need to receive progress messages.
//!
//! Concretely, this requires that the library user's [networking provider's](crate::networking) broadcast method send progress
//! messages to all peers it is connected to, and not only the validators. The library user is free to design and implement
//! their own mechanism for deciding which peers, besides those in the validator set, should be connected to the network.
