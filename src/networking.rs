//! [Trait definition](Network) for pluggable peer-to-peer networking, as well as the internal types and functions
//! that replicas use to interact with the network.
//!
//! HotStuff-rs' has modular peer-to-peer networking, with each peer reachable by their [VerifyingKey](ed25519_dalek::VerifyingKey). 
//! Networking providers interact with HotStuff-rs' threads through implementations of the [Network] trait. This trait has five methods
//! that collectively allow peers to exchange progress protocol and sync protocol messages.

/// This type's recv method only returns hotstuff messages for the current view, and caches messages from
/// future views for future consumption. This helps prevent interruptions to progress when replicas' views
/// are mostly synchronized but they enter views at slightly different times.
/// 
/// ### Pacemaker Messages
/// This type's recv method returns pacemaker messages for any view greater or equal to the current view.
/// It also caches all messages for view greater than the current view, for processing in the appropriate view
/// in case immediate processing is not possible.
///
/// ### BlockSyncTrigger Messages
/// This type's recv method returns block sync trigger messages immediately without caching.
///
/// ### Buffer management
/// If a message buffer grows beyond its maximum capacity, some highest-viewed messages might be removed 
/// from the buffer to make space for the new message.
