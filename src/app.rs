//! HotStuff-rs' interface into the business logic of users' applications.
//!
//! # Applications
//!
//! The basic interaction between HotStuff-rs and the library user is this:
//! 1. Library user specifies a state machine.
//! 2. Library user provides the state machine to HotStuff-rs
//! 3. HotStuff-rs replicates the state machine.
//!
//! We refer to the state machine in this basic interaction as the **"application"**. In short, an
//! application is a state machine that mutates
//! [two states](#two-app-mutable-states-app-state-and-validator-set), namely the *App State* and the
//! *Validator Set*, in response to receiving a payload called a [`Block`]. In other words, an
//! application can be thought of as a function (a "state transition function") with the following type
//! signature: ```(AppState, ValidatorSet, Block) -> (AppState, ValidatorSet)```.
//!
//! To specify an application, the library user must implement the [`App`] trait. This entails
//! implementing a state transition function and exposing this function to HotStuff-rs through three
//! different [required methods](App#required-methods), namely `produce_block`, `validate_block`, and
//! `validate_block_for_sync`.
//!
//! Each of the above three methods correspond to a distinct context in which HotStuff-rs will call the
//! application's state transition function. For example, HotStuff-rs will call `produce_block` when the
//! local replica is a leader and needs to produce a new block to propose it. The context in which each
//! function is called is documented in their respective Rustdocs.
//!
//! # Two app-mutable states: App State and Validator Set
//!
//! The two states that an application can mutate in response to a block are the App State, and the
//! Validator Set. Both states are stored in the block tree, which itself is stored in the pluggable
//! [`KVStore`](crate::state::kv_store) provided to HotStuff-rs by the library user.
//!
//! The **App State** is a set of key-value mappings, in which the keys and values are be arbitrary byte
//! strings. The library user is completely free to decide the structure and contents of this mapping
//! in whichever way supports their use-case. HotStuff-rs itself does not assume anything about the app
//! state, nor does it insert anything into the app state when a replica is
//! [`initialize`](crate::replica::Replica::initialize)d besides what the library user configures as the
//! `initial_app_state`.
//!
//! For more information about the **Validator Set**, read the rustdocs in the
//! [`validator_set`](crate::types::validator_set) module.
//!
//! `App` code tells HotStuff-rs to make changes to the app state and the validator set by listing the
//! changes that should be made in an [`AppStateUpdates`] or [`ValidatorSetUpdates`] (respectively) and
//! returning these changes from calls to its three methods.

/// Trait implemented by applications that are to be replicated by HotStuff-rs.
///
/// # Determinism requirements
///
/// In order for the state machine to be correctly replicated across all replicas, types that implement
/// `App` must ensure that their implementations of `produce_block`, `validate_block`, and
/// `validate_block_for_sync` are deterministic. That is, for any particular request (e.g.,
/// [`ProduceBlockRequest`]), a function must always produce the same response
/// ([`ProduceBlockResponse`]), regardless of whether the machine executing the call has an Intel CPU
/// or an AMD CPU, whether a pseudorandom number generator spits out 0 or 1, or whether it is currently
/// raining outside, etc.
///
/// The key to making sure that these methods are deterministic is ensuring that their respective
/// method bodies depend **on and only on** the information that is available through the public methods
/// of their request type. In particular, this means not reading the block tree through a
/// `BlockTreeSnapshot`, but reading it only through [`AppBlockTreeView`].

/// # Timing requirements
///
/// HotStuff-rs calls `produce_block` when a replica has to produce a block, and calls `validate_block`
/// when a replica has to validate a block.
///
/// These calls are **blocking** (synchronous) calls, so a replica will not continue making progress
/// until they complete. Because of this, library users should implement `produce_block` and
/// `validate_block` satisfy a specific timing constraint so that replicas do not spend too long in
/// these functions and cause views to timeout and progress to stall. This timing constraint is
/// exactly:
///
/// `4 * EWNL + produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration < max_view_time`,
///
/// where:
/// - `EWNL`: "Expected Worst-case Network Latency". That is, the maximum duration of time needed to send
///   a message from a validator to another validator under "normal" network conditions.
/// - `produce_block_duration`: how long `produce_block` takes to execute.
/// - `validate_block_duration`: how long `validate_block` takes to execute.
/// - `max_view_time`: the provided
///   [`Configuration::max_view_time`](crate::replica::Configuration::max_view_time).
///
/// ## Rationale behind timing requirements
///
/// Let's say a view begins at time T for the proposer of the view, and assume that:
/// - Messages take `EWNL` to deliver between validators,
/// - The time taken to process messages is negligible besides `produce_block_duration` and
///   `validate_block_duration`, and
/// - Every step begins after the previous step has ended (this is a simplifying assumption. In reality,
///   for example, the Proposer does not have to wait for replicas to receive `AdvanceView` in order to
///   start producing a block, and therefore, step 3 should really happen at
///   `T+diff(EWNL, produce_block_duration)` instead of at `T+EWNL+produce_block_duration` as below).
///
/// Then the view will proceed as follows:
///
/// |Step No.|Time after T (cumulative)|Events|
/// |---|---|---|
/// |1|`+0`|<ul><li>Proposer enters view.</li><li>Proposer broadcasts `AdvanceView`.</li><li>Proposer broadcasts `Proposal`</li></ul>|
/// |2|`+EWNL`|<ul><li>Replicas receive `AdvanceView`.</li><li>Replicas enter view.</li></ul>|
/// |3|`+produce_block_duration`|<ul><li>Proposer enters view.</li></ul>|
/// |4|`+EWNL`|<ul><li>Replicas receive `Proposal`.</li></ul>|
/// |5|`+validate_block_duration`|<ul><li>Replicas send `PhaseVote`s.</li></ul>|
/// |6|`+EWNL`|<ul><li>Next Leader collects `PhaseCertificate`.</li><li>Next Leader leaves view.</li><li>Next Leader broadcasts `AdvanceView`.</li><li>Next Leader broadcasts `Proposal`</li></ul>|
/// |7|`+EWNL`|<ul><li>Replicas receive `AdvanceView`.</li><li>Replicas leave view.</li></ul>|
///
/// In the view above (and indeed in any view), there are two possible cases about the identities of
/// Proposer and Next Leader:
/// 1. If Proposer == Next Leader, then:
///     1. The Proposer/Next Leader enters the view at step no. 1 and leaves at step no. 6, spending `3EWNL +
///       produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` in the view.
///     2. Other replicas enter the view at step no. 2 and leave at step no. 7, spending `3EWNL +
///       produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` in the view.
/// 2. If Proposer != Next Leader, then:
///     1. Proposer enters the view at step no.1 and leaves at step no. 7, spending `4EWNL +
///       produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` in the view.
///     2. Next Leader enters the view at step no. 2 and leaves at step no. 6, spending `2EWNL +
///       produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` in the view.
///     3. Other replicas enter the view at step no. 2 and leave at step no. 7, spending `3EWNL +
///       produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` in the view.
///
/// This shows that the most time a replica will spend in a view under normal network conditions is
/// `4EWNL + produce_block_duration + validate_block_duration` (case 2.1), which is exactly the
/// left-hand-side of the timing constraint inequality.

    ///
    /// # Purpose
    ///
    /// There are several reasons why implementations of `App` may want calls to `validate_block` to take
    /// *at least* a certain amount of time.
    ///
    /// For example, implementors may want to limit the rate at which views proceed (e.g., to prevent the
    /// block tree from growing too quickly and exhausting disk space), and may choose to do so by making
    /// their implementations of `produce_block` and `validate_block` cause a thread sleep until a minimum
    /// amount of time is reached.
    ///
    /// Such a thread sleep solution works to slow down consensus decisions by, among other things, causing
    /// replicas to block for the amount of time when receiving a block through a `Proposal`, delaying
    /// the sending of a `PhaseVote` to the next leader.
    ///
    /// However, such a solution will not only slow down consensus decisions, it will *also* slow down
    /// Block Sync. In general, implementors will want `validate_block` to take at least a minimum amount of
    /// time when it is called within a view, but complete as quickly as possible when called during block
    /// sync.
    ///
    /// This is where `validate_block_for_sync` comes in. With `validate_block_for_sync`, implementers can
    /// rely on the fact that `validate_block` will *only* be called within a view, adding a thread sleep
    /// or other mechanism in it will not slow down sync as long as the mechanism is not also added to
    /// `validate_block_for_sync`.
