//! The [App] trait, HotStuff-rs' interface into the business logic of users' applications.
//!
//! ## The App trait
//!
//! After receiving your app through [crate::replica::Replica::start], replicas communicate with it
//! by calling the methods it has implemented as part of the App trait when specific things happen.
//!
//! The App trait has three methods.
//!
//! The two most important ones--[App::produce_block] and [App::validate_block]--take in a request and return a response:
//! 1. `produce_block` is called when the replica becomes a leader and has to produce a new
//!    block. Your app should respond with the data and the data hash of a block extending the [parent block](ProduceBlockRequest::parent_block) included in the request, as well as the [app state updates](crate::types::AppStateUpdates) and [validator set updates](crate::types::ValidatorSetUpdates) that executing it causes.
//! 2. `validate_block` is called in two situations: when the replica receives a proposal, and when
//!    the replica is syncing. Your app should respond with whether the block is valid (according to
//!    the semantics of the application), and again with the app state updates and validator set
//!    updates that executing the block causes.
//!
//! ## Chain ID
//!
//! The [third method](App::chain_id) is called to get a "chain ID".
//!
//! Each HotStuff-rs blockchain should be identified by a [chain ID](crate::types::ChainID). This
//! is included in votes and other messages so that replicas don't mistake messages and blocks for
//! one HotStuff-rs blockchain does not get mistaken for those for another blockchain.
//!
//! In most cases, having a chain ID that collides with another blockchain is harmless. But
//! if your application is a Proof of Stake public blockchain, this may cause a slashable offence
//! if you operate validators in two chains that use the same keypair. So ensure that you don't
//! operate a validator in two blockchains with the same keypair.
