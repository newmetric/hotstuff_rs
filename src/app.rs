//! The [App] trait, HotStuff-rs' interface into the business logic of users' applications.
//!
//! ## The App trait
//!
//! After receiving your app through [start](crate::replica::Replica::start), replicas communicate with it
//! by calling the methods it has implemented as part of the App trait when specific things happen.
//!
//! The App trait has three methods, each of which returns a response when called with a request:
//! 1. `produce_block` is called when the replica becomes a leader and has to produce a new
//!    block. Your app should respond with the data and the data hash of a block extending the
//!    parent block included in the request, as well as the [app state updates](crate::types::AppStateUpdates) 
//!    and [validator set updates](crate::types::ValidatorSetUpdates) that executing it causes.
//! 2. `validate_block` is called  when the replica receives a proposal. Your app should respond
//!    with whether the block is valid (according to the semantics of the application), and again 
//!    with the [app state updates](crate::types::AppStateUpdates) and [validator set updates](crate::types::ValidatorSetUpdates)
//!    that executing the block causes.
//! 3. `validate_block_for_sync` is called when the replica is syncing. Your app should respond
//!    with whether the block is valid (according to the semantics of the application), and again
//!    with the [app state updates](crate::types::AppStateUpdates) and [validator set updates](crate::types::ValidatorSetUpdates)\
//!    that executing the block causes.
