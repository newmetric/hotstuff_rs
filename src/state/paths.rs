//! This module defines the location of each of the variables stored in the key-value store.
//! These variables are:
//! 
//! |Variable|"Type"|Description|
//! |---|---|---|
//! |Blocks|[CryptoHash] -> [Block]||
//! |Block at Height|[BlockHeight] -> [CryptoHash]|A mapping between a block's number and a block's hash. This mapping only contains blocks that are committed, because if a block hasn't been committed, there may be multiple blocks at the same height.|
//! |Block to Children|[CryptoHash] -> [ChildrenList]|A mapping between a block's hash and the children it has in the block tree. A block may have multiple children if they have not been committed.|
//! |Committed App State|[Vec<u8>] -> [Vec<u8>]||
//! |Pending App State Updates|[CryptoHash] -> [AppStateUpdates]||
//! |Committed Validator Set|[ValidatorSet]|The acting validator set.|
//! |Previous Validator Set|[ValidatorSet]|The previous acting validator set, possibly still active if the update has not been completed yet.|
//! |Validator Set Update Completed|[bool]|Whether the most recently initiated validator set update has been completed. A validator set update is initiated when a commit QC for the corresponding validator-set-updating block is seen.|
//! |Validator Set Update Block Height|The height of the block associated with the most recently initiated validator set update.|
//! |Validator Set Updates Status|[CryptoHash] -> [ValidatorSetUpdatesStatus]||
//! |Locked QC|[QuorumCertificate]| QC of a block that is about to be committed, unless there is evidence for a quorum switching to a conflicting branch. Refer to the HotStuff paper for details.|
//! |Highest Voted View|[ViewNumber]|The highest view that this validator has voted in.|
//! |Highest View Entered|[ViewNumber]|The highest view that this validator has entered.|
//! |Highest Quorum Certificate|[QuorumCertificate]|Among the quorum certificates this validator has seen and verified the signatures of, the one with the highest view number.|
//! |Highest Timeout Certificate|[TimeoutCertificate]|Among the timeout certificates this validator has seen and verified the signatures of, the one with the highest view number.|
//! |Highest Committed Block|[CryptoHash]|The hash of the committed block that has the highest height.|
//! |Newest BlocK|[CryptoHash]The hash of the most recent block to be inserted into the block tree.|
