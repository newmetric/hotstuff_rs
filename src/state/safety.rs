//! Rules and predicates that collectively guarantee the safety of HotStuff-rs SMR.
//!
//! ## Safety and state updates
//!
//! In HotStuff-rs, the key events that can trigger state updates are:
//! 1. Receiving a [`Proposal`](crate::hotstuff::messages::Proposal).
//! 2. Receiving a [`Nudge`].
//!
//! A `Proposal` or `Nudge` is considered **safe** if it is safe for it to trigger state updates inside
//! the [`BlockTree`]. This generally requires that the block or nudge is well-formed, and that the
//! quorum certificate that it references is cryptographically correct and safe. In addition, since
//! nudges implement a version of the "phased" HotStuff consensus for validator-set-updating blocks, a
//! non-Decide-phase nudge is only safe if it is broadcasted in the next view relative to the view in
//! which its justify is collected.
//!
//! This module defines two primary sets of functions, each implementing a specific aspect of safety and
//! state updates:
//!
//! The crate-public functions that this module defines fall into two main categories:
//! 1. [`safe_block`], [`safe_nudge`], and [`safe_qc`] checks **whether** a Block, Nudge, or QC is safe,
//!    respectively. One extra function, [`repropose_block`], is related to `safe_nudge`.
//! 2. [`qc_to_lock`], and [`block_to_commit`] determine **what** state updates should be made upon seeing
//!    a safe Block or a safe Nudge.
//!
//! ## Safe QC
//!
//! A safe QC must match the Chain ID of the replica (to avoid having state updates triggered by a
//! QC from another blockchain). It must also have an appropriate phase depending on whether the
//! block it justifies has associated validator set updates or not, and it must be for a known
//! block, i.e., a block that is already stored in the BlockTree.
//!
//! Most importantly, it must either:
//! 1. Reference a block that extends the branch of the block referenced by the locked QC, or
//! 2. Have a higher view than the locked QC.
//!
//! The former condition guarantees safety in case a quorum of replicas is locked on a given block,
//! while the latter ensures liveness in case the quorum has moved to a conflicting branch and
//! there exists evidence for it. The evidence would be a newly received QC with a view higher than the
//! view of the replica's locked QC.
//!
//! ## Commit Rules
//!
//! To prevent different replicas from entering inconsistent states due to Byzantine leaders causing
//! safety-threatening branch switches, the pipelined HotStuff protocol requires that a block must be
//! followed by a "3-chain" in order to be committed. This means that the block must be followed by
//! a child, a grandchild, and a great-grandchild block.
//!
//! In addition, the three QCs contained in its child, grandchild, and great-grandchild blocks, serving
//! as its "virtual" Prepare QC, Precommit QC, and Commit QC respectively, must have **consecutive
//! views**. Note however that while consecutive views are required for a block to be safely committed,
//! they are not required for a block to be inserted to the block tree, and therefore `safe_block` does
//! not enforce it. Consecutive views are also not required for a block to be locked.
//!
//! To obtain an equivalent guarantee for the phased HotStuff protocol for validator-set-updating
//! blocks, we require that the Prepare QC, Precommit QC, and Commit QC for a validator-set-updating
//! block received via nudges have consecutive views. If this flow is interrupted by a temporary loss of
//! synchrony or a Byzantine leader, the validator-set-updating block has to be re-proposed, as
//! specified in [`repropose_block`]. This rule is enforced through [`safe_nudge`]. Unlike block
//! insertions, nudges cannot cause state updates unless they satisfy the consecutive views rule.
//!
//! ## Locking Rules
//!
//! Locking serves to guarantee the safety of commit. In SMR protocols that follow the lock-commit
//! paradigm, a value has to be locked before it is committed. If a block is locked, then any new
//! proposal or nudge must "extend" it unless there exists evidence that a quorum of replicas do not
//! share this lock and have moved to an alternative branch. The idea is that even if only some replicas
//! commit, the others hold a lock to the committed value and should eventually commit it.
//!
//! The locked value is essentially a block, but we consider any QC that references the block to be
//! valid proxy for it, and hence store a locked QC instead. This enables keeping track of information on
//! the view in which a quorum of replicas last voted for this block.
//!
//! In the pipelined HotStuff protocol, a block is locked if there is a 2-chain supporting it, i.e.,
//! there is a QC for the block and a QC for its child, which serve as the block's prepare QC and
//! precommit QC respectively. In such case it is the prepare QC that is locked.
//!
//! To adapt this rule to the phased HotStuff protocol for validator-set-updating blocks, we lock
//! the block on seeing a nudge with a precommit QC for it - it is the precommit QC that becomes locked
//! this time, as by the consecutive views requirement this is equivalent to locking the prepareQC.
//! Since the block sync protocol does not involve sending nudges, we must also lock the decideQC when
//! referenced by the block. This is to ensure that subsequently received blocks are not accepted if
//! they conflict with it.

/// |`Precommit` QC|`Some(justify)`|This is equivalent to locking the Prepare QC for the same block on seeing the Precommit QC, as is done in the original HotStuff algorithm, since by the `safe_nudge` precondition, Prepare QC and Precommit QC must have consecutive views.|
/// |`Commit` QC or `Decide` QC|If `justify.block == locked_qc.block`, then `None`, else `Some(justify)`|If `justify` is a Commit or Decide QC, then under "normal" conditions `justify.block` should have already been locked on seeing a Precommit QC for the block, and hence there is no need to lock. <br/><br/> However, in case the current locked QC is not for `justify.block` (this can happen if the replica didn't receive the Precommit QC for the block, for example if the replica is receiving the Decide QC `justify` via block sync), we should still lock the `justify`. This is equivalent to locking the Precommit QC, as we do under normal operation, since the Precommit QC and the Commit QC/Decide QC have consecutive views and are for the same block.|
