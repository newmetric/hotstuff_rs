//! Functions that implement rules and predicates that collectively guarantee the safety of HotStuff-rs
//! SMR.
//!
//! In HotStuff-rs, the key events that can trigger state updates are:
//! 1. Receiving a block proposal,
//! 2. Receiving a nudge.
//!
//! If a block or a nudge is considered safe, then it is safe for it to trigger state updates inside the
//! [`BlockTree`]. This generally requires that the block or nudge is well-formed, and that the quroum
//! certificate that it references is cryptographically correct and safe. However, since nudges
//! implement a version of the "phased" HotStuff consensus for validator-set-updating blocks, a
//! non-Decide-phase nudge is only safe if it is broadcasted in the next view relative to the view in
//! which its justify is collected.
//!
//! While [`safe_block`], [`safe_nudge`], and [`safe_qc`] define what it means for a block, nudge, or
//! QC to be safe, and hence be allowed to trigger state updates, [`qc_to_lock`] and [`block_to_commit`]
//! can be used to determine which updates can be made on seeing a safe nudge or a safe block.
//! This depends on the commit and locking rules.
//!
//! ## Safe QC
//!
//! A safe QC must match the Chain ID of the replica (to avoid having state updates triggered by a
//! QC from another blockchain). It must also have an appropriate phase depending on whether the
//! block it justifies has associated validator set updates or not, and it must be for a known
//! block, i.e., a block that is already stored in the BlockTree.
//!
//! Most importantly, it must either:
//! 1. Reference a block that extends the branch of the block referenced by the locked QC, or
//! 2. Have a higher view than the locked QC.
//!
//! The former condition guarantees safety in case a quorum of replicas is locked on a given block,
//! while the latter ensures liveness in case the quorum has moved to a conflicting branch and
//! there exists evidence for it. The evidence would be a newly received QC with a view higher than the
//! view of the replica's locked QC.
//!
//! ## Commit rules
//!
//! To avoid inconsistent state due to Byzantine leaders causing safety-threatening branch switches, the
//! pipelined HotStuff protocol requires that in order to be committed a block must be followed by a
//! 3-chain. Concretely, the three QCs referenced by its child, grandchild, and great-grandchild,
//! serving as its prepareQC, precommitQC, and commitQC respectively, must have consecutive views.
//! [`block_to_commit`] enforces this rule for the pipelined protocol for non-validator-set-updating
//! blocks. It is not required in [`safe_block`] since blocks can be safely added even if their
//! ancestors don't have consecutive views - but commit of the branch will only be triggered once
//! there is a 3-chain.
//!
//! To obtain an equivalent guarantee for the non-pipelined protocol for validator-set-updating blocks,
//! we require that the prepareQC, precommitQC, and commitQC for a validator-set-updating block received
//! via nudges have consecutive views. If this flow is interrupted by a temporary loss of synchrony or
//! a Byzantine leader, the validator-set-updating block has to be re-proposed, as specified in
//! [`repropose_block`]. This rule is enforced through [`safe_nudge`]. Unlike block insertions, nudges
//! cannot cause state updates unless they satisfy the rule.
//!
//! ## Locking rules
//!
//! Locking serves to guarantee the safety of commit. In SMR protocols that follow the lock-commit
//! paradigm, a value has to be locked before it is committed. The idea is that even if only some
//! replicas commit, the others hold a lock to the committed value and should eventually commit it.
//!
//! The locked value is essentially a block, but we consider any QC that references the block
//! to be valid proxy for it, and hence store a lockedQC instead. This enables keeping track
//! of information on the view in which a quorum of replicas last voted for this block.
//!
//! As mentioned above, if a block is locked, then any new proposal or nudge must "extend" it,
//! unless there exists evidence that a quorum of replicas do not share this lock and have
//! moved to an alternative branch.
//!
//! In the pipelined HotStuff protocol, a block is locked if there is a 2-chain supporting it, i.e.,
//! there is a QC for the block and a QC for its child, which serve as the block's prepare QC and
//! precommit QC respectively. In such case it is the prepare QC that is locked. To adapt this rule to
//! the non-pipelined protocol for validator-set-updating blocks, we lock the block on seeing a nudge
//! with a precommitQC for it - it is the precommitQC that becomes locked this time, as by the
//! consecutive views requirement this is equivalent to locking the prepareQC. Since the block sync
//! protocol does not involve sending nudges, we must also lock the decideQC when referenced by the
//! block. This is to ensure that subsequently received blocks are not accepted if they conflict with
//! it. This is enforced through [`qc_to_lock`].
