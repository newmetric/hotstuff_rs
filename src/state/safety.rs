//! Rules and predicates that collectively ensure that all state updates made to the block tree are
//! safe.
//!
//! # Block Tree state updates
//!
//! A state machine replication algorithm like HotStuff-rs is considered "safe" if it is impossible for
//! two replicas to commit conflicting state updates as long as less than a threshold of validators are
//! Byzantine.
//!
//! The top-level state updates that a HotStuff-rs replica can perform are performed by the
//! [top-level state updaters](BlockTree#impl-BlockTree<K>-1) category of methods defined in the
//! `block_tree` module on the `BlockTree` struct.
//!
//! The crate-public methods in this (`safety`) module are only relevant to the
//! [`insert`](BlockTree::insert), [`update`](BlockTree::update) top-level state updaters. The remaining
//! three state updaters have much simpler preconditions and perform much simpler state mutations, and
//! thus do not need helper functions like those defined here.
//!
//! The following sections discuss the methods in this module in more detail. First,
//! [Two categories of methods](#two-categories-of-methods) list these methods. Then, [Locking](#locking)
//! discusses an important cross-cutting invariant (locking) that multiple separate methods in this module
//! work together to maintain.
//!
//! # Two categories of methods
//!
//! The crate-public methods defined in module `safety` fall into two categories. Each category of
//! methods follow a consistent naming convention and play a distinct part in ensuring that all updates
//! made to the block tree are safe. Simply put, the first category of methods check **whether** state
//! updates can safely be triggered, while the second category of methods help determine **what** state
//! updates should be triggered.
//!
//! ## Category 1: safe_{type}
//!
//! Methods in this category: [`safe_qc`], [`safe_block`], [`safe_nudge`].
//!
//! These methods check **whether** a `QuorumCertificate`, `Block`, or `Nudge` (respectively) can safely
//! trigger state updates. Methods in this category are part of the preconditions of `insert` and `update`.
//!
//! Methods in this category check two kinds of properties to determine safety:
//! 1. Internal properties: these properties are simple and can be checked without querying the block
//!    tree. For example: checking in `safe_nudge` that `nudge.justify` is a `Prepare`, `Precommit`, or
//!    `Commit` QC.
//! 2. External properties: these properties are more complicated and checking them entail querying the
//!    block tree. For example: checking in `safe_qc` that either: (i) `qc.view` is greater than
//!    `block_tree.locked_qc()?.view`, or (ii). `qc.block` extends (directly or transitively) from
//!    `block_tree.locked_qc()?.block`.
//!
//! ## Category 2: {type}\_to\_{lock/commit}
//!
//! Methods in this category: [`qc_to_lock`], [`block_to_commit`].
//!
//! These methods help determine **what** state updates should be triggered in `update` in response to
//! obtaining a `QuorumCertificate`, whether through receiving a `Proposal`, `Nudge`, or `NewView`
//! message, or by collecting enough `Vote`s. Methods in this category are called inside `update`.
//!
//! ## Outlier: repropose_block
//!
//! This module also defines a method called [`repropose_block`]. This does not fit neatly into either
//! of the above two categories in terms of name or function, but is closely related to `safe_nudge`
//! in that it serves to help proposers choose a block to propose that satisfy the "consecutive views"
//! property that `safe_nudge` checks.
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! The most integral, and yet least obvious invariant that the methods in this module maintains has
//! to do with *locking*.
//!
//! Locking entails keeping track of a block tree variable called
//! ["Locked QC"](super::block_tree#safety), and doing two things with it:
//! 1. **Checking** every QC received or collected against it in `safe_qc`. Only QCs that pass this check
//!    and therefore "satisfy the lock" are allowed to cause state updates.
//! 2. **Updating** the Locked QC whenever it is appropriate, according to the logic implemented by
//!    `qc_to_lock`. `qc_to_lock` is called in [`BlockTree::update`] every time the latter is called.
//!
//! Locking serves to guarantee the uniqueness of commits. The idea is that if any single honest replica
//! *commits* on a block, then either: (i). All other honest replicas have also committed the block, in
//! which case the commit is trivially unique, or (ii). If not all honest replicas have committed the
//! block, then a quorum of replicas has at least *locked* on the block, which ensures that (i) will
//! eventually be true.
//!
//! ## Checking against the lock
//!
//! The 3rd predicate of `safe_qc` checks whether any received or collected QC satisfies the lock and is
//! therefore allowed to trigger state updates.
//!
//! Note how this predicate has two clauses, joined by an "or":
//! 1. `qc.block` extends from `locked_qc.block`, *or*
//! 2. `qc.view` is greater than `locked_qc.view`.
//!
//! Both clauses serve distinct purposes which are discussed at length in the original HotStuff paper.
//!
//! In short, the first clause (the "safety clause") will always be satisfied in the stable case, where
//! in every view, either a 1/3rd of replicas lock on the same `locked_qc`, or none lock.
//!
//! In unstable cases, however, where e.g., messages are dropped or a proposer is faulty, less than
//! 1/3rd but more than one replica may lock on the same `locked_qc` in the same view, and therefore a
//! `Block` or `Nudge` that conflicts with `locked_qc` may be proposed in the next view and be accepted
//! by the replicas that didn't lock on `locked_qc` in the previous view. In this case, the replicas that
//! *did* lock on `locked_qc` in the previous view will not be able to accept the new `Block` or `Nudge`,
//! and unless the 3rd predicate of `safe_qc` includes a relaxing clause, these replicas will be stuck,
//! unable to grow their blockchain further.
//!
//! This is where the second clause (the "liveness clause") comes in. This clause enables the replicas
//! that did lock on the now "abandoned" QC to eventually accept new `Block`s and `Nudge`s, and does so
//! by relaxing the third predicate to allow `Block`s and `Nudge`s that build on a different branch
//! than the current `locked_qc.block` to cause state updates as long as the QC they contain has a
//! higher view than `locked_qc.view`.
//!
//! ## Updating the lock
//!
//! Any time [`BlockTree::update`] is called, Locked QC should potentially be updated, and `qc_to_lock`
//! decides what Locked QC should be updated *to*.
//!
//! The logic used by `qc_to_lock` to decide which QC to lock on is documented in
//! [the doc for `qc_to_lock`](qc_to_lock#qc_to_lock-logic). Below, we explain the rationale behind
//! this logic, including how and why the implemented logic is slightly different from the logic used
//! in the original HotStuff (PODC '19) paper.
//!
//! Which QC `qc_to_lock` decides to lock on upon receiving `justify` partly depends on what
//! `justify.phase` is:
//! - If `justify.phase` is `Generic`, `Prepare`, or `Precommit`, `qc_to_lock`'s
//!   decision rule is exactly the same as the decision rule used in the algorithm in the original (PODC'
//!   19) HotStuff paper that corresponds to the [operating mode](crate::hotstuff#operating-mode) that the
//!   `Phase` is part of (recall that the pipelined mode corresponds to Algorithm 1, while the phased mode
//!   corresponds to Algorithm 3).
//! - On the other hand, if `justify.phase` is `Commit` or `Decide`, `qc_to_lock` will decide to lock on
//!   `justify` (as long as the current `locked_qc.block` is different from `justify.block`). This is in
//!   contrast to the logic used in Algorithm 1 in the original HotStuff paper, which does not update
//!   `locked_qc` upon receiving a `Commit` QC (there is no phase called `Decide` in the original HotStuff
//!   paper).
//!
//! The reason why the original HotStuff does not lock upon receiving a `Commit` or `Decide` QC and
//! HotStuff-rs does becomes clearer when we consider that the original HotStuff makes a simplifying
//! assumption that receiving any proposal implies that we have received every proposal in the chain
//! that precedes the proposal. E.g., receiving a proposal for a block at height 10 means that we (the
//! replica) has previously received a complete set of proposals for the ancestor blocks at heights
//! 0..9, *including for every phase*.
//!
//! This assumption simplifies the specification of the algorithm, and is one that is made by many
//! publications. However, this assumption is difficult to uphold in a production setting, where
//! messages are often dropped. HotStuff-rs' [Block Sync](crate::block_sync) goes some way toward making
//! this assumption hold, but is not perfect: in particular, Sync Servers only send their singular
//! current [`highest_qc`](crate::block_sync::messages::BlockSyncResponse::highest_qc) in their
//! `SyncResponse`s, which could be a QC of any phase: `Generic` up to `Decide`.
//!
//! This means that if we use the same logic as used in Algorithm 1 to decide on which QC to lock on
//! upon receiving a [phased mode](crate::hotstuff#phased-mode) QC, i.e., to lock only if
//! `justify.phase == Precommit`, then we will fail to lock on `justify.block` if `justify.phase` is
//!  `Commit` or `Decide`, which can lead to safety violations because the next block may then extend
//! a conflicting branch.
//!
//! Because extending the Block Sync protocol to return multiple QCs in a `SyncResponse` could be
//! complicated (in particular, it would probably require replicas to store extra state), we instead
//! solve this issue by deviating from the original HotStuff slightly by locking upon receiving a
//! `Commit` or `Decide` QC.
//!

/// ## Preconditions
///
/// The `Block` or `Nudge` containing `justify` must satisfy [`safe_block`] or [`safe_nudge`]
/// respectively.
///
/// ## Commit Rules
///
/// To prevent different replicas from entering inconsistent states due to Byzantine leaders causing
/// safety-threatening branch switches, the pipelined HotStuff protocol requires that a block must be
/// followed by a "3-chain" in order to be committed. This means that the block must be followed by
/// a child, a grandchild, and a great-grandchild block.
///
/// In addition, the three QCs contained in its child, grandchild, and great-grandchild blocks, serving
/// as its "virtual" Prepare QC, Precommit QC, and Commit QC respectively, must have **consecutive
/// views**. Note however that while consecutive views are required for a block to be safely committed,
/// they are not required for a block to be inserted to the block tree, and therefore `safe_block` does
/// not enforce it. Consecutive views are also not required for a block to be locked.
///
/// To obtain an equivalent guarantee for the phased HotStuff protocol for validator-set-updating
/// blocks, we require that the Prepare QC, Precommit QC, and Commit QC for a validator-set-updating
/// block received via nudges have consecutive views. If this flow is interrupted by a temporary loss of
/// synchrony or a Byzantine leader, the validator-set-updating block has to be re-proposed, as
/// specified in [`repropose_block`]. This rule is enforced through [`safe_nudge`]. Unlike block
/// insertions, nudges cannot cause state updates unless they satisfy the consecutive views rule.
///
/// ## Commit Rules
///
/// This function implements the "high-level" [Commit Rules](super::safety#commit-rules) by evaluating
/// the following "lower-level" Commit Rules:
///
/// |`justify` is a|Block to commit|Reasoning|
/// |---|---|---|
/// |`Generic` QC|If the "consecutive views" requirement is met, then `Some(great_grandparent_block)`, else, `None`|Implements the commit rule for non-validator-set-updating blocks.|
/// |`Prepare` QC or `Precommit` QC|`None`|Theoretically, we could commit the `grandparent_block` on receiving a `Prepare` QC and the `parent_block` on receiving `Precommit` QC, but we choose not to do so.|
/// |`Commit` QC|`Some(justify.block)`|Implements the commit rule for validator-set-updating blocks.|
/// |`Decide` QC|`Some(justify.block)`|Validator-set-updating blocks are usually committed on seeing `Commit` QC. However, during sync `Commit` QCs are not sent, so blocks have to be committed on seeing `Decide` QCs instead.|
///
/// ### Preventing redundant commits

/// committed, then `block_to_commit` will return `None` so that the caller does not commit the same
/// block multiple times.

/// parent, or its grandparent. We do not need to check deeper.
