//! Signed messages, votes, and certificates.
//!
//! The basic definition made in this module is the **[`SignedMessage`]** trait, which, as its rustdocs
//! explain, is implemented by data types that contain: 1. A message, and 2. A digital signature over
//! said message whose correctness can be verified against a `VerifyingKey`.
//!
//! Although `SignedMessage` on its own is implemented by a single library-defined type (namely
//! `AdvertiseBlock`), most of its utility comes from being a supertrait of the more important
//! **[`Vote`]** trait, also defined in this module.
//!
//! "Votes", along with "Certificates" are two notions that are common to both the
//! [HotStuff](crate::hotstuff) and [Pacemaker](crate::Pacemaker) subprotocols, and are essential to
//! their functioning. These are represented in this module by the `Vote` and [`Certificate`] traits.
//!
//! `Vote`s and `Certificate`s are data types that represent, respectively: a *single validator's*
//! digitally signed, non-repudiable agreement to a "decision", and the same thing but for a *set of
//! validators* instead of only a single one.
//!
//! Certificates are formed by using structs called "Collectors" to aggregate the signatures of
//! Votes with matching `ViewNumber`s and `ChainID`s together until the collected
//! [`SignatureSet`](crate::types::basic::SignatureSet) contains votes from a
//! ["quorum"](Certificate::quorum) of validators in a validator set. Collector structs generally
//! implement the same basic logic whichever specific `Vote` type they collect into whichever specific
//! `Certificate` type, which is why this module can define a **[`Collector`]** trait that generalizes
//! across collector implementations.
//!
//! The `Collector` trait in turn allows this module to define a generic "Active Collector Pair"
//! struct. An **[`ActiveCollectorPair`]** is not itself a `Collector`, but combines multiple collectors
//! collecting votes for different "active" validator sets into a single struct and wraps interactions
//! with them inside a single interface, which simplifies usage.
