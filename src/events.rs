//! Definitions of hotstuff-rs events for user-defined event handling and for logging.
//! Hotstuff-rs events refer to the high-level descriptions of actions that are expected of
//! a replica correctly executing the protocol.
//! 
//! The [event](Event) enum is a wrapper enum for the all event types defined in this module.
//! The event types are structs, storing all necessary information about a given event. 
//! This information always includes a timestamp corresponding to the exact time when the event happened.
//! 
//! Event notifications are sent from the [algorithm](crate::algorithm) and [sync_server](crate::sync_server)
//! threads and received and processed by the [event_bus](crate::event_bus) thread, according to the
//! predefined handlers.
//! 
//! Additionally, a [convenience method](Event::publish) is defined for publishing an event by sending it
//! via an appropriate channel.
