//! Subscribable events that are published when significant things happen in the replica.
//!
//! ## Event enum
//!
//! Significant occurences in the replica include committing a block, starting a new view, broadcasting
//! a proposal, or receiving a proposal.
//!
//! Each of these significant occurences correspond to a variant of the [event enum](Event). Each
//! variant tuple in turn contains an inner struct type. For example, the
//! [insert block variant](Event::InsertBlock) contains the [`InsertBlockEvent`] struct type.
//!
//! Each inner struct stores information that summarizes the particular kind of event. This information
//! always includes a timestamp corresponding to the exact time when the event occured.
//!
//! ## Registering event handlers
//!
//! Library users can register event handler closures, these are internally called by the library's
//! [event bus](crate::event_bus::start_event_bus) thread when the handler's particular event variant
//! happens.
//!
//! Custom event handlers can be registered using the [replica builder pattern](crate::replica), while
//! default event handlers that log out events (e.g., into the terminal, or into a log file) can be
//! enabled in the [configuration](crate::replica::Configuration).
//!
//! ## Timing
//!
//! Events are always emitted **after** the corresponding occurence is "completed". So for example, the
//! [insert block event](InsertBlockEvent) is only emitted after the insertion has been persisted into
//! the backing storage of the block tree.
