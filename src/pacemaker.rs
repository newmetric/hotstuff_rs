//! [Trait definition](Pacemaker) for pacemakers: user-provided types that determine the 'liveness' behavior of replicas.
//!
//! Specifically, pacemakers tell replica code two things:
//! 1. [View timeout](Pacemaker::view_timeout): given the current view, and the highest view I (the replica) has seen
//!    consensus progress, how long should I stay in the current view to wait for messages?
//! 2. [View leader](Pacemaker::view_leader): given the current view, and the current validator set, who should I consider
//!    the current leader?

/// # Safety
///
/// Durations returned by [Pacemaker::view_timeout] must be "well below"
/// [u64::MAX] seconds. A good limit is to cap them at [u32::MAX].
///
/// In the most popular target platforms, Durations can only go up to [u64::MAX] seconds, so keeping returned
/// durations lower than [u64::MAX] avoids overflows in calling code, which may add to the returned duration.
