//! Functions for logging out library events of varying levels of importance.
//!
//! HotStuff-rs logs using the [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) crate. To get these messages
//! printed onto a terminal or to a file, set up a [logging
//! implementation](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/#available-logging-implementations).
//!
//! Log messages with past tense event names (e.g., "Proposed") indicate an activity that has completed, while
//! those with present continuous tense events (e.g. "Committing") indicate an activity that is still ongoing and
//! may not get to complete because the process exits.
