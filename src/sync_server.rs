//! The server side of the block sync protocol.
//! 
//! ## Block sync protocol
//! 
//! When the [algorithm thread](crate::algorithm) sees a message containing a quorum certificate from a future view,
//! this is taken to indicate that a quorum of validators are making progress at a higher view. This causes the replica
//! to start syncing.
//! 
//! The sync protocol is a request-response protocol that proceeds as follows:
//! 1. The lagging replica selects a random peer from its current validator set (the "sync replica").
//! 2. It then sends the sync replica a [sync request](crate::messages::SyncRequest) telling them the highest committed 
//!    block that it knows (if it knows any committed block).
//! 3. The sync replica responds with a [sync response](crate::messages::SyncResponse) containing the highest quorum
//!    certificate it knows, and a sequence of blocks extending from the lagging replica's highest committed block 
//!    (if the request specifies it) or the beginning of the block tree (otherwise).
//! 4. Upon receiving the response, the lagging replica checks how many blocks are included in it:
//!     - If the response contains no blocks, then the replica returns to executing the progress protocol. 
//!     - If it does contain blocks, then the replica validates the included blocks and quorum certificate and inserts 
//!       them into its block tree, and then jumps back to step 2.
