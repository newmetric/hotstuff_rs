//! The server side of the block sync protocol.
//!
//! When the [algorithm thread](crate::algorithm) sees a message containing a quorum certificate from a future view,
//! this is taken to indicate that a quorum of validators are making progress at a higher view. This causes the replica
//! to start syncing.
//!
//! ## Block sync protocol
//!
//! The sync protocol is a request-response protocol whereby replicas try to download blocks it may
//! have missed during downtime or network outage.
//!
//! The protocol proceeds as follows:
//! 1. The lagging replica selects a random peer from its current validator set (the "sync replica").
//! 2. It then sends the sync replica a [sync request](crate::messages::SyncRequest) asking them to start syncing from
//!    a start height: the replica's highest committed block's height + 1 (or 0, if the replica hasn't committed any
//!    blocks). It also specifies how many blocks at most it wants to receive.
//! 3. The sync replica responds with a [sync response](crate::messages::SyncResponse) containing a chain starting from
//!    the request's start height and of length at most the maximum of the sync replica's limit and the request's limit.
//! 4. Upon receiving the response, the lagging replica checks the blocks that are included in it:
//!     - If the response contains no new blocks, then the replica returns to executing the progress protocol.
//!     - If it does contain new blocks, then the replica validates the blocks and quorum certificate and inserts them
//!       into its block tree, and then jumps back to step 2.
